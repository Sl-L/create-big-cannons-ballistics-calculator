## What's this?
This is a unofficial ballistics calculator for the Minecraft mod Create: Big Cannons, which uses currently linear drag for its projectile motion simulation.

## Installation
There're stand-alone binaries for windows and debian-based linux distros on the releases page

## How to use
Load the coordinates of the cannon mount and the target, then add the projectile velocity and drag-to-mass ratio 
(temporary, using powder charges and ammo type will be correctly implemented soon<sup>™️</sup>)
